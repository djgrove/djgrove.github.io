<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
	I’m a recent graduate of Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. Most recently, I worked
	for Cal Poly’s Information Technology Services department on the Web Content
	Management Systems team. We used Drupal CMS and associated PHP modules to
	service nearly all of Cal Poly’s static subdomains.
</p>

<h3>Development</h3>
<p>
	My professional background lies in web application development, primarily with
	backend services. I really enjoy this work, but I have so many other areas I would
	like to explore further. I’m devoting time now to personal projects to improve my
	understanding of Angular and other frontend frameworks, and will be gracefully
	deploying them soon.

<p>
	I'm really passionate about developing beautiful software, and I love learning about
	best practices that come along with each tool--though I still have lots to learn.
	This passion has given me interest in DevOps tools and procedures that keep the build
	process as simple as possible for devs. I’ve lead a project to integrate Docker into
	my team’s workflow, and have aspirations to learn about Jenkins/Chef and other elements 
	of the CI/CD pipeline.
</p>

<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<p>
	When I'm not writing code, I love running (<a href="https://www.gopoly.com/sports/xc/2017-18/bios/grove_devon_lrx4?view=bio">I ran for Cal Poly SLO from 2014-2017</a>),
	playing guitar/making music, chess, reading, and FIFA.
