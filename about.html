<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
	I'm Devon, and I'm currently a Software Engineer at Apptio. I graduated from 
	Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo in December 2018 with a B.S. in Computer Science. I
	also ran track and field and cross country at Cal Poly from
	<a href="https://calpoly.prestosports.com/sports/track/2016-17/bios/grove_devon_p64t?view=bio">2014-2017</a>.
</p>

<p>
	When I'm not writing code, I love traveling to as many places as possible, running, skiing, playing guitar,
	playing chess, and all things Chelsea FC.
</p>

<h3>Development</h3>
<p>
	My professional background lies in web application development, primarily with
	backend services. I really enjoy this work, but I have so many other areas I would
	like to explore further. I’m devoting time now to personal projects to improve my
	understanding of Angular and other frontend frameworks, and will be gracefully
	deploying them soon.

<p>
	I'm passionate about developing beautiful software, and I love learning about
	best practices that come along with each tool--though I still have lots to learn.
	This passion has given me interest in DevOps tools and procedures that keep the build
	process as simple as possible for devs. I’ve lead a project to integrate Docker into
	my team’s workflow, and have aspirations to learn about Jenkins/Chef and other elements 
	of the CI/CD pipeline.
