I'm a recent graduate of Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. Most recently, I worked for Cal Poly's Information Technology Services department on the Web Content Management Systems team. We used Drupal CMS and associated PHP modules to service nearly all of Cal Poly's static subdomains.

My exposure and interest in programming developed late in high school, though my infatuation with computers began when I was really young. One of my fondest memories is sitting on my dad's lap at age 3 playing [The Neverhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Neverhood), and of course growing up in the tech Oasis that is Redmond, Washington, it was hard not to become interested in software development.

## Software Interests

My professional background lies in web application development, primarily with backend services. I really enjoy this work, but I have so many other areas I would like to explore further. I'm devoting time now to personal projects to improve my understanding of Angular and other frontend frameworks, and will be gracefully deploying them soon.

I'm also passionate about DevOps tools and procedures. I've lead a project to integrate Docker into my team's workflow, and have aspirations to learn about Jenkins/Chef and other elements of the CI/CD pipeline.

## Hobbies

I first got into running through track and cross country in high school. I was fortunate to be able to continue competing in college for Cal Poly for three years until injuries ended my career in 2017.

My other hobbies include golf, music, playing guitar, chess, reading, and
