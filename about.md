My exposure to computers began with the likes of Backyard Baseball, Freddy Fish, The Neverhood and other late 1990's computer games. To me, they were magic. I couldn't fathom what made them work; all that mattered to me was that they did.

It wasn't until I got much older that I got into programming. I was a voracious reader growing up, and Wikipedia provided the perfect medium to learn about new things. Eventually I started editing articles and enjoyed tinkering with the pages, which basically consisted of basic HTML and [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

## About This Site

Originally. I was hosting this on AWS using a full blown (micro) EC2 server instance. At some point, I realized this was far more than I would ever need for my personal portfolio site. I decided to switch over to a simple S3 bucket to host my static pages, and eventually GitHub Pages became my tool of choice.

This website is running the Jekyll WCMS, many thanks to Antriksh Yadev's [brilliant article and blog](http://antrikshy.com/about/this-site) about his own website for the inspiration. In short: Jekyll is a static site generator geared towards building blogs, but by customizing the default HTML layouts, SaSS, and JavaScript you can do some really cool stuff. Jekyll has exposed me to SaSS and has really encouraged me to avoid duplicating code (even the hex value of a repeatedly used color). I definitely encourage you to check out Antriksh's site if you're new to web development and want inspiration to start building cool stuff.

As you can tell, I'm no god with CSS... I've worked pretty hard on getting the navbar how I like it but it's very excessive on mobile. Consider the UI of this site to be my CSS sandbox.

## Hobbies

I love running. So much, in fact, that [I compete in track and cross country for my college](). Traveling to competitions and training each day puts some strain on my mental fortitude for classwork, but I don't doubt this has contributed tremendously to my time-management skills. I don't regret a moment of my opportunities to run.

My other hobbies include listening to music, playing guitar, chess, reading, and [Rocket League](http://store.steampowered.com/app/252950/) when I get the chance. Highly recommended.

## Contact me

The best way to contact me is through LinkedIn or by my email through GitHub. Don't hesitate to reach out!

### If you are a prospective employer seeking my academic coursework

Beyond the projects included on this page, I have quite a bit of coursework from Cal Poly hosted in private GitHub repositories. This is done to protect academic integrity of myself and others. I will gladly make this available upon request.
